Someone came with a brilliant idea to use PICO-8 for that. We loved both the retro feel and ease of use that came with this tool. Technological constraints made it an intriguing design challenge. PICOHOT was created by team of 3 people - me, Wojcieh Dziedzic (@WojtekDziedzic) and Mariusz Tarkowski (@m_tarkovsky). Thanks to the PICO-8 community and zep for creating such an amazing tool. You guys made working on PICOHOT a blast! Main points: SUPERHOT’s “time moves only when you move” mechanic.

This is a tiny adventure based directly on FEZ, a game by the Polytron Corporation. It is a fan work, and was not made in collaboration with or endorsed by them. FUZ features a total of 8 distinct areas. Its visuals, mechanics, and puzzles are all based off those in the original. I made the music myself, as while FEZ has a phenomenal soundtrack a lot of it does not translate well to PICO-8. I can't claim to be very musically inclined, but I hope it works well enough. Also, while there is no save system, the game is completable very quickly if you know what to do so getting back to your previous place is not hard. And if you'd like to follow my work, check out my Twitter: @Jusiv_ Thanks for playing, and let me know what you think!",FUZ

Before you play: Dank Tomb is a pay-what-you-want title, which means that if you prefer to play it for free, it's perfectly okay to do so. But I'd really appreciate it a lot if you choose to pay for it through itch.io, or support my future work on Patreon! Supporters get bonus stuff as a thank-you from me: an expedition journal with additional story for Dank Tomb and access to unminified PICO-8 source code for the game ($5+). Enjoy the game, and let me know what you think! A lot of blood, sweat, tears and elbow grease went into making this game, so I hope you'll have as much fun playing it as I had making it! If you'd like to put the game down and return to it later, the game features a special room where you can save your progress. Once you see the ""progress saved"" message, it's safe to close the browser/console. To delete your progress (to get 100% completion on a new playthrough, maybe?), press Enter and select ""delete progress"" from the in-game menu. Warning: irreversible!

 I have taken my most recent Pico-8 game Kid Bludd, stripped it down to the essentials, and I am releasing it as a kind of Platforming Game Starter Kit. I removed all logic that isn't game agnostic, so it is hopefully a good starting point for pretty much any platformer. It's not super complicated, but does a lot of stuff I see many games not doing, which I consider table stakes for a platformer that feel good. Features the basics: Forgiving Jumps",AdvancedMicroPlatformerStarterKit

I couldn't fit the two mini-games on it, sadly. My buddy    @Gimbernau and I gave ourselves 30 days to do this entire thing, and what a ride it was. Because of the token limit, I decided not to put instructions inside the game, so there's a ""How to play"" section down below. I hope you enjoy! If you have some thoughts about the game or if you find any bugs, please leave a comment in the comment section :) PS.: There is another version of PvZ here in the forum!

Use your sun to buy plants! Left-click on the plant you want to buy and then left-click once again (don't drag and drop!) on a tile to drop your plant. Right-click if you want to de-select your plant.
Each plant has a different power to help you crush the zombies. And everyday you get through, you get a new plant!

178,FunFetched,https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=16247,Nanoman,https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=29017,CC4-BY-NC-SA,"Basically, a fan game heavily inspired by the early Mega Man series that I started working on a few months ago. A big thanks to Gruber Music for stepping in during the final stages and providing some great tunes for the 6 different levels! If you're already a fan of Mega Man, you should feel right at home here. For the un-initiated, here's a breakdown of the controls. You'll often come across life (white glowing orbs) and energy pods. The energy pods will re-fill your special weapons, but you'll need to have the weapon you want to re-fill selected before you pick it up. Warning:
This game is HARD. Like, Mega Man hard. Expect to die a lot until you start to memorize stage layouts and enemy patterns. The game is indeed beatable; I've run the whole thing myself a few times. It takes about 15-16 minutes if you're in a hurry and don't die. I plan on making a full play-through video soon. There's a handy, built-in timer for you speed-runners out there that'll show up at the end of the game. Developers:
The code in this cart has been squashed with p8tool's luamin command. This was necessary to get this beast of a thing in under the compressed file size limit. Don't expect anything legible by clicking the code link. I'll see about posting the un-compressed code somewhere. This is my first full-blown PICO-8 title. Some of the code is rather ugly; partly because early on, I was unsure of how best to save space, and partly because I had to utilize every token-saving strategy under the sun. I've done my best to comment the un-compressed code so you can follow what's going on. The map data was generated and lightly compressed by external map editing carts (one for each level) and jammed into strings; there are 76 ""screens"" in all. The last level is also a string, but it's copied from map memory into a string at runtime, because the compressed file limit said I had to do it that way. I hope to do a write-up on just how I handled all of that soon. That's about all my fried brain can think of at the moment. Enjoy! Edit: I can't seem to upload anything to my profile here other than images, so I've uploaded the un-compressed cartridge data to github: https://github.com/flimflamboyant/NanoMan/tree/master",Nanoman

With this update the game now progresses across multiple battles, soldiers can level up and have a talent tree, and 2 new enemy types have been added. The game has 16 levels, and you need to beat level 16 to win. However, levels don't progress 1 at a time, the level you are assigned is based on the combined level of all your soldiers. If a soldier survives a battle they will gain a level and be granted 1 skill point. So if all soldiers survive level 1 you will progress to level 4, if they all survive level 4 you will progress to level 7 etc.. So it's possible to do a perfect run and win the game by playing only 6 battles. If a player doesn't survive they will be replaced with a new recruit. As you progress through the levels new recruits will start with more skill points so if you lose any soldiers or have a full wipe you won't be set back too far (and you can respec your soldiers). If you abort a mission after any soldiers have died they will remain dead. However, because the game is only saved between missions you can ""save scum"" by resetting the cart and continuing the game with all soldiers alive.",ShadowsofDunwich

 Here is a cleaned up version of the 3D library that I put together for the Pico Fox game. The demo code is commented in more detail, but here is the basic gist. Please feel free to use this in your projects as well as to update it and make it work better. New features for version 2:
--Significant speed increase (2X!)
--Load models from strings to save token space
--Python script to translate from "".obj"" files to compressed string Run the script in the folder with the files that you are converting.
python low_poly_compress-01.py filename.obj Detailed instructions and script found on GitHub.

Backgrounds from the Pico-8 Community This cart is less about the game and more about the people that contributed to it. It's tribute game in more ways than one.  First off, it's a tribute to Space Invaders Extreme that originally appeared on the Nintendo DS. It was Space Invaders kicked up a notch with a total sensory overload.  Second, it's a tribute and thank you to all the great little carts coming out of the Pico-8 forum. In particular, Invader Overload uses several of the carts from the TweetJam thread as manic backgrounds. Designs from zep, NuSan, kometbomb and others are included and create one hell of a show. There were so many cool little demos coming out of the TweetJam thread that I just needed to find a way to use them. I consider Invader Overload a sort of TweetJam jukebox and hopefully we can all expand on it because you can totally add your own background! There's plenty of room left on the cart so give it a try. This cart also features some great music from Brian Follick, aka, @gnarcade_vgm. He made a great music track specifically for this game along with a few sound effects, and without that collaboration, this game would have fallen completely flat. ",InvaderOverload

Thanks to  @dw817 for finding it!) So, here it is, my first ever fully completed cart. I have a real bad habit of starting lots of things and never finishing them, and this was destined to be just another one of those things. I started work on this about a month or two ago, and did most of the work back then. I decided I needed a bit of a break from my current project and thought, hey, why don't I go back and finish this? I've learned a lot since then, and generally improved a bunch, so most of this code is a mess, and doesn't use things it really should like objects, but, everything functions well enough at least. It's super unoptimized though, mostly because I was under the assumption there was no CPU limitations in Pico-8, and going back to finish it up, I didn't really bother fixing that. The particle system is my own, written for the main cart I've been working on, but the background previously was a stolen tweetcart (the function was even called ""stolentweetcart()"") I was using as a placeholder. It was distracting anyway, so I replaced it with the particles and used them to make a few other things nicer as well.  The main goal here was to make it compliant to the 2009 Tetris guideline (a big document the Tetris company uses that says exactly how a Tetris game should be made) though I disregarded that going back to it, so it's halfway or so there. Also, SRS isn't implemented properly, it's good enough but it's not perfect, and the title is a typo I thought was funny so I rolled with it. Anyway, enough of my rambling, hope you enjoy!

Created as part of a long-running video tutorial series. If you want to learn how to make a game like this, check out this thread! How to play You control the pad at the bottom of the screen. You need to destroy the bricks by hitting them with a ball. If the ball leaves the bottom of the screen you lose. You need to move your pad left and right to keep the ball on the screen. If you move the pad while you hit the ball, you can change the angle of the ball's trajectory. There are also different powerups, which appear when you destroy a blue block. Powerups Orange = Slow - Slows down time
White = Life - Gives you an additional extra life
Green = Sticky - Makes you pad sticky. It makes the ball stick to the paddle so you can launch it again
Blue = Expand - Expands the size of your pad
Black = Reduce - Shrinks you pad but also gives you a 10x score modifier
Red = Megaball - Lets the ball smash through blocks without changing direction
Yellow = Multiball - Splits the ball into two balls. You only lose a life if you lose your last ball Sudden Death - if there are only 3 bricks left when the ball hits the pad, the game goes into Sudden Death mode. Bricks will start blinking as they are about to explode. If you hit a brick while it's blinking, you'll get extra points. Scoring Hitting multiple bricks in a row increases your score multiplier to a maximum of 7x. Hitting the ball with the pad resets the multiplier back to 1x. Losing all lives resets your score to 0, but you can continue playing. For the highest score possible, try finishing the game without losing your lives. For an additional challenge and even more points, press up or down on the start screen for Fast Mode. Let me know if you see any bugs. Otherwise, Enjoy!",BreakoutHero

 My first PICO-8 game !
It's a tiny ""metroidvania"" platformer where you play as a cube.
You gain more and more abilities as you progress. There are multiple environments, some collectables and you can find a boss fight at the end. The controls are :
Z/X/C/V - Jump
Left/Right - Move
Down - ??? If you run into a bug please report it so I can try and fix it.
Feedback is also appreciated :) I hope you enjoy the game !",MetroCUBEvania

 Is probably more a demake than a remake. So far: Do not know if cartridges is the correct category, but since I reached the token limit, this is almost finished.
Compressed code size is ~12kb, so I will probably add 4 more levels and hopefully some missing sound effects.  token limit is annoying, because the whole map memory is free and could be used for intro screens or more levels. Here is the uncompessed source code:

The code is .. well, it is what it is :) I just kept piling stuff in there and it could be extensively improved and cleaned up (for example there are three different functions that create smokey stuff). So take it with a pinch of salt. There's a bit of slow down on some of the busy levels which could probably be optimised by making sure not to create more blobby things over a certain threshold, but it always seems to remain playable.",TheyStartedIt

Button 1 to jump
Button 2 to peck The regular peck strikes at an angle and give Poulet greater velocity, to allow jumping father.  HOLD UP while pecking to do a ""soft"" peck, where your regular jump arc is not changed, for precise and controlled attacks.  HOLD DOWN while pecking to do a vertical peck, to avoid flying off a ledge during an attack. Every third balloon popped has a prize-- the first prize is a TOQUE, which lets Poulet take one hit before defeat.  If you have your Toque when you collect yet another prize, then you get HOTSAUCE which turns Poulet into HOTWINGS! who is an INVINCIBLE FLAMING DEATH BIRD Killing blows struck consecutively without hitting the ground will give you a score multiplier.  Same goes for when using Hotwings. Enjoy!  Right now, the high score is 639200!   Thanks again to Pizza and Innomin and of course Zep, and the whole community.

Update 9/11/15: Yeah, so with all this work over the horizon, I just wanna take a final stab at completing this cart before I don't have any more time. Total physics re-vamp.  Collisions are handled more sensibly thanks to Innomin's advice.  The new physics system made the speed and ranges of things a little different, so constants have been tweaked, and levels have been adjusted.  I think it's less slippery, more controllable, and I can't duplicate any embedding in tiles bugs at this point.  (I bet one of you folks can though!) Feature changes: There's bound to be bugs with all the changes, so please let lose and break it!

 In response to the forum feedback, and watching someone else play it for a bit, I've decided it needed a lot of changes!  Here they are... Original Post: Hey guys! I've been cranking on this for a while, only sparsely tweeting about it from time to time.  I figure it's done enough now to get some code review and bug finding by the community. It's quite playable, but if you beat the fourth level, there's only a black abyss as your reward.  I can't fit any more levels proper on the cart, so the last big feature I want to put in is some level-mutator code to repeat the existing levels with some re-arrangement to extend the game (And that there, is the joy of Pico 8-- the limitations taking us to wild places like that!) I'd enjoy hearing what you guys think.  Personally I look forward to feedback on just how hard it might be-- it might suffer from programmer-is-the-only-playtester syndrome at the moment, resulting in some serious difficulty. I feel the collision code needs some tips from the masters.  There's also some really dumb work around for my lack of knowledge about how we concatenate strings in Lua.   Oh and I desperately need to write more music-- this tune is gonna drive you insane pretty soon. I hope you all like it! EDIT:
I didn't tell you how to play!
Z to jump.
X/C to Headbutt-dash
If you get multiple kills on a single dash, you get a score multiplier!
Free lives are awarded by score.",SuperPouletPoulet

(30/01/22 - Happy Birthday Cab Ride! 1 today!) Drive a train, forever, through a dreamlike land. Transport passengers to their destination. Watch the world go by. Listen to chilled out chiptune music. In Cab Ride you can drive thousands of different train routes through rolling hills, winding tunnels and weaving between the tall buildings of vast cities. You can drive the train for as long as you like. When you're ready to end your journey, hold down the left arrow key to announce the last station. Stopping at stations along the way means you can pick up and drop off passengers. Try and stop at the marker at each station for a high rating. Or don't! It's up to you. Cab Ride is a casual train simulation, not aiming for real world accuracy, but like a real train, it takes a while to brake. If you're overshooting stations, watch for the alert for the next station and reduce the throttle so you're ready to stop. v1.2 v1.1 v1.0.3 v1.0.2 v1.0.1 v1.0 Programming - Ben Jones /  @Powersaurus Twitter Music - Stephen 'rych-t' Jones / Twitter / Soundcloud Based on code from the Pseudo-3D Racer tutorials by Tom Mulgrew/ @Mot https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=35767 licensed under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International​ ​https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/​ All source and assets are licensed under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International​ ​https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/​

Help Harry as he travels around the world putting a stop to the mushroom gang! HOW TO PLAY: Walk - arrow keys Jump - Z or C Lick things - X High Jump - jump while licking Long Jump - jump while licking AND holding a direction. GOAL: Find the portal at the end of each level. Harry will get hungry over time, so make sure to eat enemy mushrooms as well as berries you find sitting around the levels. TIPS: Blue mushrooms are tough and can't be licked normally. If you eat a spicy pepper, Harry will turn red-hot for a few seconds. Use this time to eat the blue mushrooms.
If you lick while in the air, Harry can get a little extra boost. By licking on the ground and then jumping soon after, Harry can jump extra high or extra far, depending on whether or not you are holding a direction key down.
See if you can find every present in the game! You can get lots of berries from presents by licking them. PROTIP!!! Is Harry too easy for you? Pause the game with ENTER and choose hard mode!  Fixes:
v1.1 - fixed possible softlock in level 2.
v1.2 - made hard mode accessible from menu instead of a weird code noone can do. Fixed some trouble areas.

the lights in the shuttle

It was a great excuse for me to finally dig into some of the newer PICO-8 features added since my last big project, particularly tline and oval drawing. Special thanks to thattomhall for playtesting and freds72 for providing me his textured polygon function! (It is used with minor modifications for drawing various elements of the house.)

Why would you change rooms when clearly this one has all the danger and excitement and danger that one could possibly need?!  Come to the One Room Dungeon and live the rest of your newly mysterious-and-exciting life there!!! One Room Dungeon is my entry to Ludum Dare #37, of which the theme was 'One Room'! It's definitely my most ambitious LD entry so far and I'm very happy with it too! Sadly I had to rush the audio a bit towards the end because time was going faster somehow. The game is also on Itch.io and of course there's the Ludum Dare submission! Feedback is most welcome, especially on the Ludum Dare page! Enjoy! Edit: If you are interested, I wrote a post-mortem about this game and the making of this game! Thank you to everyone who played the game and thank you again if you leaved some feedback! :) Jam version:

The results were very fun, so I decided to flesh it out a bit more and make a small demo out of it. The controls are pretty simple, since this is a highly advanced spacecraft simulation: press X to warp to the next planet.

Pico de Pon brings favorite characters from across the PICO-8 library together for intense block-swapping battle. INSTRUCTIONS Player I:
Arrow keys, move cursor
X (or M or V) key, swap blocks
Z (or N or C) key, manually raise stack Player II:
E/S/D/F keys, move cursor
A (or Shift) key, swap blocks
Q (or Tab) key, manually raise stack  Swap blocks beneath the cursor. Horizontal or vertical runs of three or more matching block types are cleared. Swapping a block over an edge will cause it to fall. The stack rises over time. The game ends when blocks reach the top of the stack. The rising of the stack is delayed while matched blocks are clearing. Combos are triggered by clearing more than three blocks at once. Chains are triggered by matches caused by blocks falling due to cleared blocks below. In SOLO mode, points are scored only from combos and chains. In VS mode, combos and chains send garbage blocks to your opponent’s stack. Garbage blocks fall on the top of the stack. They can only be cleared by touching matches of other blocks. Garbage clears to standard blocks. Because these blocks stay suspended in air while converting, they provide an opportunity for counter attack by lining up matching blocks beneath to set up chains. Special attack blocks [!] will send metal garbage even without a combo or chain. Metal garbage behaves like regular garbage but will not clear when touched by clearing regular garbage.

This is the second public domain tileset I'd like to share with everybody (after the top-down tileset released a few weeks ago). Like the one before, it was originally created for my PICO-8-based game design workshop, but it would be a shame to limit its use to only the workshop participants. So I made it a little bit more universal, bundled it with the engine code I used for the workshop, and released it here! The tileset contains heads and bodies for a variety of characters, enemies, obstacles, three terrain types, lots of stuff to climb on, some random items and a few additional things no platformer should go without. As far as I'm concerned, this is all public domain, so feel free to use all of it or parts of it in your platformer projects, and feel free to remix or alter it in any way you want. The cartridge is commented as heavily as the PICO-8 compressed size limit would allow, but I'm happy to answer any additional questions you might have.

However, it is only (heavily) ""inspired"" by the SCUMM engine, not a true replica - for that you'll want good ol' SCUMM-VM. My plan was to make it possible for anyone to make their own point & click adventure games in PICO-8! All the code and API documentation can be found on GitHub (link below):
 • Multiple Rooms (32+, technically)
• Pathfinding for walking
• Dialogs between Actors
• Cut-scenes
• Camera system (pan-to, follow, static)
• Room transitions (""iris"", cut)
• Customisable Verbs
• Fake 3D depth ""Auto-Scaling"" of Actors
• Z-plane ordering of objects/actors
• Custom scaling for Actors/Objects
• Global-level (background) & Room-level scripts
• Game start-up script
• Object dependencies
• Replace Color (to allow re-use of room/object gfx)
• Adjustable Room Brightness Levels
• Screen ""shake"" effect
• Proximity (between Actors/Objects)
• Animations for Actors and Objects The above ""game"" is just a silly demo that I created as part of testing the engine.  Unfortunately, due to the large size of the engine + game code, it had to be ""minified"" to allow posting to the BBS.  The original demo game source can be found here (link). Please see the SCUMM-8 Wiki (link) for details on how to get started creating your own SCUMM-8 game, as well as the the full API reference. The following PICO-8 posts & resources were very helpful in the making of SCUMM-8:
• picotool: Tools and Python libraries for manipulating Pico-8 game files
• Overcoming tokens
• Sample Code: Screenshake and Fading
• A* pathfinding example
• Coroutines

It is a small terrain renderer I made to see what was possible to do with pico 8 and how far. The terrain definition is based on height maps of 32x32. The cartridge goes with 4 different maps. The rendering has two modes:
 a real time one, sort of voxel based that allows to move camera/lighting
 an actual rasterization that is computed in background when the camera/lighting stays still controls:
 arrows: in camera mode, move the orbital camera, in lighting mode, move the directional camera
 when in camera mode, pressing x/v while moving allows zooming in/out
 z/c: switch camera / lighting mode
 a/q: hide/show info (current mode, mem and cpu usage)
_ w: access to the menu to change settings As it is a technical demo/test there's not much to do except moving around. you can play around with settings to change maps, palettes. I also included 5 different filters to dither lighting and terrain. I have optimized quite a lot but there is still some room. The stable 30fps when moving near terrain is hard without implementing occlusion (because it is limited by rectfill) which will eat a lot too. I've cleaned the code a bit so that it should be readable. I dont know if I will work on this again later on but possible upgrades can be:
 ingame height map editor
 free camera and collision with terrain
 optimizations
 rendering improvement (shadow cast, sun and specular on water...)
_ animation in renders (waves, birds, clouds...) hope you'll enjoy !",TerrainRenderer

•  Procedural generation
•  Musicality!
•  Old-school gameplay
•  But actually winnable though Arrow keys to move/rotate/drop blocks, X + arrows to move rogue and fight monsters. Full instructions can be found in game. I hope you enjoy it. Thoughts This version of the game took a long time to make – more than 40 coding sessions during evenings/weekends of July-November 2017. I had the core game fully working within a few sessions, and the rest has literally been set dressing and ""polish"" (it still looks like programmer art!). Presentation is quite pompous in places, e.g. a full menu system; this is simply because I wanted to make the game as ""finished"" as possible (I teach game dev so I want to set a good example). In order to fit the standard 10x20 grid (plus 4 invisible rows for spawning blocks) on the screen, I had to use 6x6 pixel sprites for each cell rather than the easier option of a map of 8x8 pixel cells. Making clear pixel art in 6x6 tiles is hard, but I’m quite happy with the monster designs and animations – I think they have personality. This was my first Pico-8 / Lua game so wasn’t sure how restrictive the CPU or token/char count would be in practice. I was worried it would struggle with drawing so many sprites but seems okay? (stat() was showing about 10% CPU at worst). Token budget was more than enough too, but I only realised this once I had carefully implemented most of the critical content – so in general the code is unnecessarily dense. I was disappointed at first that it would easily fit into the restrictions, but then I noticed that I’d gone well over the limit for the compressed .p8.png format, which added a nice little challenge towards the end. Had two runs at crunching - the first involved me hard-coding a load of values and adding short function references, but this meant that I would have to retest the entire game thoroughly to check I hadn't broken anything, so instead I rolled back and just minimised the comments :) A warning for beginners: Tetris clones might seem like an ideal ""basic"" project to work on, but I found there are lots of unforeseeable logic problems/exceptions, and quite a few subtle UX tricks that you have to do to make the game ""feel"" right (some I've done, some I haven't). So beware, I guess. I’ve got it so the music is in sync with the GFX, but I have had to implement procedural music in order to do this. Originally I had a song that I played at a set tempo and synced up with the monsters ""dancing"", but if the Pico-8 loses focus (e.g. to desktop) the audio continues to play while the GFX freezes, so the music goes out of sync. Also noticed that pausing and unpausing the game seemed to cause the Pico-8 to throw the sync out by 2 ticks. In the end I created separate instruments as SFX and made my own ""song"" by triggering them on certain ticks. It’s no accident that the game follows a 12-bar blues pattern; finally my GCSE music lessons paid off. With so much RNG it was hard to balance, especially while preserving the luck-factor of a roguelike. This meant that I had to complete several runs each time I changed something, to allow for fluctuations in RNG. The longer I've worked on it, the more I've lost all objective sense of how difficult it is, but it is definitely winnable. I hope you guys enjoy it anyway; do let me know how you get on.

In the end, I managed to fit the size from nearly 20000 bytes into 15360 bytes. For any future PICO-8 game dev who are planning to put a lot of text in the game, pay a lot of attention to compressed size restriction. --

Explore their hazardous surfaces as you rescue your stranded crew, salvage lost cargo, and zap hordes of enemies. Can you survive long enough to reach the Mysterious Planet X? Or will you be consumed by a slime, zapped by an enemy blaster, boiled in acid, or choked to death by a toxic atmosphere? CONTROLS Arrow Keys/Directional Pad - Move
[Z] - Jump (tap, or hold for higher jumps)
[X] - Use Held Item
[Down] + [X] - Pick up / Swap Item SCORE There are several ways to earn score as you traverse a planet's surface: Bopping enemies
Zapping enemies
Securing cargo
Transporting friendly crew off the surface
Completing levels
Blasting off from the planet in a new Star Cruiser
Several secret bonuses you'll need to discover! PLANETS As you delve deeper into space, the planets will expand in size, add more difficult room layouts and variations, increase the chance for high gravity, unlock new hazardous biomes (including burning lava planets, sliding ice planets, and rare toxic atmospheres!), more challenging enemy variants, more enemy crew, and fewer useful items to help you along the way. While the first few planets might not cause you much trouble, by the time you reach the Mysterious Planet X, you'll need the skills and bravery of a true Space Ranger to survive! SPECIES Humans are boring! While they're the most common species in the Space Rangers, the other sentient species have special bonuses to help in their adventures.  Along with all the random features of each planet, you'll need to accustom yourself to the unique ability of your randomly chosen cadet. Can you reach the Mysterious Planet X with a cadet from every species? CREDITS Game by @tmi_robot.  For developer logs and other information, search #littlespacerangers on Twitter. Uses portions of @matthughson's Advanced Micro Platformer library, which can be found here https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=46229.â€‹; CHANGE LOG ---------------- v1.3 ---------------- --- GAMEPLAY --- o  Lowered the number of screens per planet, and randomized the chance of extra screens on later planets instead of always having them be bigger, which:
1) makes the game easier
2) varies up the landscape more frequently
3) presents the player with a win feeling more often, making the game more fun overall. o  Removed the increase in enemy hit points on later planets, as, with no visual indicator, it's confusing and not fun to discover deep into a run.
o  Removed the need to press up to enter the ship, removing the need to learn another action
o  Fixed a bug where your high score wouldn't be updated when you win the game
o  Changed screen clear score to take into account planet difficulty
o  Changed score to not be stored as decimals, as score should never get close to 32k and conversion used tokens. Forced new save version to _13, to clear old scores as this and gameplay changes make old scores meaningless. --- VISUALS --- o  Adjusted the HUD window size so that the full vertical play area can be seen properly
o  Added a HUD prompt when near an item, instructing the player on how to pick it up
o  Adjusted the title screen to be centered better, shifting all status displays a little higher
o  Added random flavor text dialog strings to the crash sequence
o  Added flavor text dialog strings that describe the overall difficulty of a planet upon landing
o  Added ability to specify a blood color for death particles (robots no longer bleed!)
o  Renamed the ""talk-o-tron"" to ""tele-tron"", to better match its concept --- AUDIO --- o  Added a sound effect when entering the ship at the end of a planet
o  Added a sound effect for the Planet: Cleared banner --- CODE --- o  Updated the include pico-8 package to v0.2.0i (netting some free tokens!)
o  Added back in code comments I had to remove a long time ago for .png format space and reorganized code for better readability
o  Recaptured a bunch of tokens through various methods (multiple if chains converted to ""if ands"", some ifs that werenâ€™t necessary (nil checks when nil is ok), a few missed multiple assignment lines, a few unnecessary assignments in reset() and other functions, a few never-used code paths (extensibility that was never used or generic functions that are only called in one place), and other assorted cleanups.",LittleSpaceRangers

But keep an eye on your energy level and make sure you can find your way back through the deep and twisted caves.  Build block fortresses with a variety of materials.
 Use the Far-View 3D Map and GPS to stay safe.
 Instructions:
s,f: turn left and right
e,d: move forward and backwards
lshift or z: jump (hold to jump higher if upgraded) The mouse is required for mining and building.
Click on shop computer to enter store menu. Ore and gems will auto-sell. With laser selected, click and hold on a block to mine it. Circular progress bar will indicate how long is left. Precious ores will take longer to mine. With a placeable block selected, click on the side of an existing block to place a new block. Energy will deplete when moving, jumping or mining. The battery can be recharged by standing on the glowing yellow charge squares near the shop. When your energy goes to zero, you will lose most of your money and be teleported back to the starting point.  Recommendations: Notes:
This game uses a modified ray-casting engine based on tutorials from (https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html). This was extended to work with voxels, reading in a local 3-dimensional map array. The map is generated dynamically as the player moves around. However, it is set up such that the same block will always exist at the same x,y,z coordinates. In addition, there is a user map that is used to store the locations of blocks that the user added or removed. These are essentially stored in a sparse matrix. There is currently no way to save your constructions. It might be possible to save some aspects of the world with the persistent cart data, but I don't know that 256 bytes will be sufficient. Clipboard import and export might be a better way to allow folks to share creations. The code is a dog's breakfast. Token count wasn't really a problem for me on this one, but it was a struggle to keep frame rate acceptable with the world rendering code. I'd love to be able to increase the view depth without dropping to 15 FPS. -electricgryphon",VoxMineD

 LAST UPDATE maybe: minor fixes and controller changes for more compatibility, see this post for the rundown UPDATED UPDATE: 2.0 with automap and tons of other changes! See this post for details UPDATE: 1.1 RELEASE! See my post somewhere down below detailing what's new/changed What started as an attempt to recreate a Wizardy-style dungeon crawl sorta morphed/evolved into it's own thing. So, now it's Wizardish! Featuring: Everything is complete at this point and I'm pretty happy with it all (other than the incredibly ugly monster sprite. I don't know how anyone here makes the amazing pixel art they do). I am curious about balance/difficulty though..I can complete the game with all four classes, but I'm not sure how much of that is down to me having drawn the maps lol. Would be very interested in everyone's feedback for possible rebalancing thanks to 0xabad1dea for the Castle Ruins tune posted originally at https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=3531 it was a really great fit and makes the whole thing feel way more professional than it should Enjoy!",WizardishAFirstPersonGridBasedDungeonCrawlervtinyupdate

I hope y'all enjoy exploring this little 8-bit world I've made. it's also on itch here, which includes native exports, and the soundtrack. speaking of, I would like to extend special thanks to @kitorchid, who made the incredible cover art for the soundtrack, and @osmoru, whose adorable artwork formed the basis of the cartridge label design. In addition to those commissions, I also received wonderful artwork of Sybil from @MarziManed and @_pexl, who are both very cool artists that you should check out as well! And of course, I would like to thank all testers and of course my friends, without them none of this would have been possible.  some statistics (from version 1.0):
number of songs: 9
number of music patterns: 33
number of SFX: 63
non-empty map tiles: 3180
sprite animation frames: 99 (computed at runtime)
bg animation pixels: 60
number of object types: 25
number of in-game objects: 734
tokens: 8190
code size prior to data interleaving: 19435 bytes in other words! for PICO-8, it's a big game. sometime I'd like to write a blog post about all the tricks I did to squeeze everything in there, but for now, I'm just happy to finally have it out here. hope y'all enjoy it! [UPDATE version 1.1]
The game now makes use of the ""secret"" pico-8 color palette-- the result is far more colorful, while still retaining the color contrast between the day and night segments. additionally, balloons and ribbons now respawn, making the game a tad less frustrating. a couple bugs have also been fixed, and several have been added.  for the record, this is intended to be the last non-bugfix release for the game-- so I hope y'all enjoy it! [/UPDATE] [UPDATE version 1.1.1]
1.1.1 is primarily a bugfix release, and addresses the following issues: [/UPDATE] [UPDATE version 1.1.2]

Mot's Grand Prix is a pseudo 3D Formula 1 racer inspired by Grand Prix Circuit, Continental Circus and a bunch of other 80s/90s racers I've forgotten :). Strap into your single seater and blast around 6 classic race courses: Or enter the championship and try to be top of the points table at the end of the season. The game has 4 difficulty levels plus a practice mode to learn the courses without the pressure of racing. You can also enable mouse control in the pause menu. It has 3 settings: ""Steering"" mode can be quite playable if you use a large window size or full-screen mode. Use the keyboard keys to accelerate/brake as usual.
""Full"" mode is not really playable unless you're some kind of robot, but can be useful for other input devices if they can be configured to output mouse movements (e.g. a Steam controller). This is a game where you have to slow down for the corners!
Use the colour of the racing line to judge your speed.",MotsGrandPrix

But this is a good thing: poop becomes flowers and flowers bring much joy to the world. Eat fruit, avoid poop, flowers increase the score multiplier, eating flowers makes the multiplier smaller. Use arrow keys to steer, use Z or X to jump over hazards. This is a very quick project we did with iLkKe, as Tic Tac Toad. Going to write about the game in my blog in the near future, had so much fun making the game. The game is also playable at itch.io Update 1.2: You can also use LEFT/DOWN and UP/RIGHT to rotate the worm, it's much more comfortable on a Pocket CHIP. Able to skip the level bonus countdown.

 This is my first Pico project. It's just a Minesweeper clone - I wanted to start with a known quantity just to get a feel for Lua and the API. I figured that in the unlikely event that the Pico becomes a hit handheld console, at least all those Minesweeper fans will have an implementation ready to go.  Then I found about the search function in splore and realized that somebody already made one :). Well, I guess there is two to choose from now :).",Mine

In the town, there are several services available: Once in the dungeon, you can wander around and fight things.  You gain experience fighting creatures, and when you get enough experience you can level up at the tavern.  When you gain a level, you can increase one of your attributes: Your goal is to make it down to the bottom level and kill the lich queen.  If you do, you win.  But be warned - she is very tough!

79,ilkke,https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=12773,Matchy Matchy,https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=4022,No License,"Welcome to MATCHY MATCHY, the puzzle game of animal love. CONTROLS: O - confirm selection (in menus), make a match (in game), quit game (in pause menu)
X - back (in menus), pause game (in game), resume game (in pause menu)
CURSORS - select options (in menus), move cursor (in game) HOW TO PLAY: Connect pairs ( or more ) of matching animals to solve puzzles, get points, and make love not war.
To make a match, move the cursor so that at least 2 matching animals are directly above, below or to the side of the cursor, then press O (Z on keyboard). Matching more than 2 animals yields more points: Pair ( 2 of a kind ) = 10 pts
Love triangle ( 3 of a kind ) = 20 pts
Double date ( 2 pairs ) = 30 pts
Love rectangle ( 4 of a kind ) = 40 pts GAME MODES: There are two modes, the relaxed PUZZLE mode and the hectic TIME ATTACK mode. PUZZLE mode - The aim is to try to clear all the pieces form the board so that no animal is left behind. You don't have to clear the entire board to unlock the next level, though. There are 35 levels in total. Can you clear them all? This mode encourages forward thinking and careful planning. Beware of making Love Triangles as this might leave an odd number of animals behind. TIME ATTACK mode - The aim is to play as long as possible and get the highest score. As you play, new pieces are added to the board, faster and faster. If you run out of valid moves, several pieces will get added to the board at once! Also any wrong move will be punished by an extra piece.
When you clear enough of the board with no moves left, you will level up. Levelling will generate a new board and slow down the timer a bit. The game is over when you run out of space on the board. This mode encourages quick thinking and changing strategy on the fly.

The author acknowledges that love knows no limits and no man, animal, machine, deity or other entity should attempt to impose such limits.",MatchyMatchy

Thanks to the wonderful davemakes for giving me permission to do this! The goal is to reach level 15 by clearing 450 blocks. If the board fills up you lose. You clear blocks in 2 ways: ⬅️/➡️  ⬇️  ❎ (z/c/n) 🅾️ (x/v/m)  Press ❎ + 🅾️ to start the game! If you're playing on mobile, I recommend swapping the rotation buttons with the inverse rotation pause menu option. Some players find the falling block shadow confusing. If you would rather turn it off, you can toggle whether it displays with ""hide shadow"" and ""show shadow"" in the pause menu. The full code (broken up into multiple files for readability) is available on github here. If you're curious, you can follow the development progress on twitter. Finally, if you like this, please go check out the original Mixolumia. It's gorgeous, juicy, addictive, and relaxing, and the dynamic soundtrack is absolutely amazing. Plus it uses the PICO-8 color palette! v1.2 v1.1

The map is stored in a long string and is generated from a Blender OBJ file. The station is as complex as I can make it before running out of compressed code space. To make something larger, I think I would have to switch to more of a 3D tile system with room building blocks that snap together.

74,minsoft,https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=15648,Tube Runner,https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=30776,CC4-BY-NC-SA,"Gameplay Fly through the tunnel as fast as possible avoiding the walls. The tunnel is divided in to Zones, with four Quadrants per zone. Each zone is progressively longer and more difficult than the previous, with sharper turns, more turns, and narrower sections. Each quadrant has a time limit - note that this is not the time limit that the quadrant must be completed in, but the time until your ships engine power is cut (T+ engine shut-off). Engine power is required for anti-gravity and maneuvering as well as propulsion...ie if the time runs out your hope lies in gliding (or sliding!) to the finish. As quadrants advance, the time limit becomes stricter. Note that your progress in the quadrant is indicated by the right hand HUD gauge. Hitting walls will slow you down, and reduce the energy of the ship (indicated by gauge on left hand side of HUD). Energy will be slowly replenished during the period of flying through the 'safe section' at the end of each ZONE (grey section with orange stripes). If energy becomes fully depleted the ship will fail and you will lose a life. Similarly, failure to complete a quadrant in time will cost a life. You begin the game with three lives, indicated by the three red lights on the left hand side of the dashboard. Points are continuously awarded for progress, with a bonus for completing each quadrant (unless T+ shutdown occurs). Additional ships can be unlocked by making progress in the game. Faster ships will yield higher scores than slower ones.",TubeRunner

The PC version adds more bosses, cards, updated graphics - while still keeping the gameplay-feel of this preview. Wishlist on Steam! In Cards with Personalities, players take on the role of a humble hero trying to assemble a team of great personalities to defeat the weird bosses that roam the lands. Each turn, you will play cards from your hand to gain Gold, Attack or other effects (like converting monsters to your side). You can spend Gold to acquire new cards from your deck. Attack is used to slay monsters, which earns you Gold and other cool effects. The battlefield is always changing so you have to adapt and come up with new strategies to defeat all eight bosses! Keyboard: Arrow keys | Controller: D-pad or Joystick  Keyboard: Z | Controller: A / Y Keyboard: X | Controller: B / X (All actions that you can take are indicated at the bottom screen) Every turn starts by you drawing five cards from your deck. Your deck always starts with the same ten cards, seven mediocre bards and the three common guards. In order to win you will need to buy and defeat cards in the middle lane to build a better deck. To do that, first draw from your deck by pressing the action button, then select which card you want to play and again presss the action button. After that, select the monster or minion you want to slay / buy. If you want read more about the cards, press the secondary button on them at any time. There are three types of cards: Minions Cost Gold to buy and are indicated by the color of light blue (or brown for common cards). When bought, they are put in the graveyard and will be shuffled in the deck when there are no cards left to draw from your deck. The effects of the minions are activated when they are played.",CardswithPersonalities

This example cart includes a few pictures I made, but the true purpose of releasing the engine is to enable everybody who is not me to make even cooler pictures with it! It's easy to define new shapes with one or two screenfuls of code. Just load the cart up inside PICO-8 and scroll below the ""pictures go here"" line. You can play with the examples in there, or add completely new pictures. There is documentation available that walks you through the concepts and explains everything needed to make it all work. If you're interested in how the engine itself and its renderer works, I have a Patreon where the full, unobfuscated source code is available to all $5+ patrons!

You can press down to go half-speed, left and right to scan through the parts of the chorus. It's a cover of this. The audio and graphics go out of sync and I've coded to accomodate for this, but it seems like it's unpredictable. You'll probably hear a glitch as it loops. On my machine the graphics are like .5% slower than the audio. IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO there is this M variable in the code you can tweak. EDIT: Alternate self-corrupting version.

 ABOUT:
NULL is a surreal adventure game. What you see in the end depends on what you can find on the way.
A 100% playthrough can be completed in 10-15 minutes, if you know where everything is. This is my third full Pico-8 game (not counting stuff from game jams)! I made it over the course of November and December 2017. All assets and code are my own work. If you want to see more of my stuff, check out my Twitter: @Jusiv_ CONTROLS: TIPS: CHANGELOG:

'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the sea
Not a creature was swimming, not you and not me;
The lights were all strung on the coral with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
The wee fry were nestled all snug in their beds;
While visions of sugar-worms danced in their heads;
When up from the surface there came such a splashing,
I sprang from my bed to see what could be happening. Up, up to the top I swam like a flash,
Looked up through the ripples, popped up with a splash.
When what to my protruding eyes did appear,
But a crash-landed sleigh and eight whiplashed rein-deer,
With a little old driver so frantic and quick,
I knew in a moment he must be St. Nick. They paddled like puppies, his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:
""Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donner and Blitzen!
To the shore of the beach! to this lonely atoll!
Now swim on up! swim on up! swim on up all!""
As awkward as kittens dropped into a bath,
They bobbed and they flailed and sought for a path; And then, in a twinkling, reindeer on the beach
Were prancing and pawing the sand with relief.
As I dipped 'neath the waves, and was turning around,
Into the water St. Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur, which was quite a blunder,
His clothes got all soaked and were pulling him under;
I was quite astonished to hear him call out
to me he was waving and said with a shout ""What ho, my good fish! You've been very good!
I'm here to bring gifts to your fine neighborhood!
But, alas! All the presents I brought for your friends
Have been lost at sea and I might get the bends.
Our tanks are all dented, and I very much fear
we have only wetsuits for seven reindeer.
Dasher, that rascal, lost his on that trip
we took to Fiji on our polar cruise ship. ""My friend, will you help me? I'm in dire straits
For all o'er the world empty stockings await
Will you find all the gifts and deliver each one?
Will you wear the red hat and make Christmas come?""
I solemnly blooped and I bubbled assent
I would see it through to the very last present! His hand rose up all the way to his head
and came down again with his fine cap of red
He gave it to me and he said with a sigh,
""You're Santa now, fish. You are the guy!""
With a wink of his eye, he gave me a smile
I knew I had nothing to fear from this trial;
He sloshed to the beach, and tapped his red nose
The sleigh came together and in the air rose He sprang right aboard, the reindeer all heartened,
And away they all flew, as fast as a marlin.
But I heard him exclaim, as I floated, awestruck—
“Happy Christmas to all, and to all, best of luck!”

I fixed the fix because it was stealing 7% of CPU from you when the TV was on, sorry about that. Also, no more weird screen display thanks to qbicfeet! Here are the instructions to use the cart:
I know the instructions are intimidating but it's actually easier than it looks. If you're hesitating, please give it a go and see how it turns out. If you have any question, feel free to ask here. 
tiny tv base cart instructions: On the limitations:
The main limitation is of course the 10x11 screen resolution.
But there is also the regular CPU limitation which already ~70-75% filled by the TV rendering. The remaining 25% will need to be enough (it should be largely enough in most cases) for your games. Otherwise, consider reskinning your TV to something lighter (see ""on the sprite-sheet"" section). Those are the only limitations for the jam but of course, regular Pico-8 restrictions apply as well. The TV can be turned on and off with the player2's 'O' button ('tab' on a keyboard) or through the pause menu (hit 'enter'). On the cart's code:
At the beginning of the cart there are a few variables you can set only once and only there: Then, there are variables you can change whenever in your code: These variables are also used by the base cart, which will automatically recenter the tv and direct it towards you. This can be ignored by setting these variables again each frame. Next are the base functions of your game: _game_init(), _game_update(), _game_draw(). They behave exactly like the regular _init(), _update() and _draw() functions except _game_init() is called when the tv is turned on. _game_shutdown() is called when turning off the TV.
_set_screen_text() lets you add static text around your tv. it uses the tv_add_text function: Both _game_shutdown() and _set_screen_text() are optional and can be deleted if you don't wish to use them. Then there is space for your own functions but you can put them before that if you like. And then there are the base cart's internal functions which you should not change. Changing these functions is against the rules of the jam. Please don't do it. Note: the TV can be turned on/off in the code by calling 'tv_turn_onoff()' On sound:
The base cart calls sfx(0) and sfx(1) upon turning on and off the tv. You can of course change these sfx to whatever you like. You are free to use as many sfx as you normally can in Pico-8 and same thing for the music! On the sprite-sheet and the map: (+reskinning TV)
The base cart uses the second half of the sprite-sheet (which is also the second half of the map) as voxel layers for the TV and also for the tile in the background.
You are invited to modify these layers and reskin your tv this way.
If you do so, don't forget to set the tv_transparency_col and tv_screen_height variables if needed.
Note that if black cells are in the screen frame, they will get the screen color, whatever their depth.
Also note that the rendering of the TV renders all non-transparent cells and that is heavy on CPU so try to do empty cases rather than filled ones (i.e. do like it is done on the base cart). You are also invited to change the background tile. You are free to use the free half of the sprite-sheet as well as the free half of the map, as you like! On jamming:
Most important instruction here: when participating to the jam, please make sure to... have fun!!! [ end of the instructions ]

I was also interested in exploring ambient structures in Pico-8, and thought they would pair nicely with lo-fi music. Thanks to Zep for the incredibly cute (and meta!) artwork and animation.

You have three basic types of skills you can use in combat: Attacks, Spells, and Actions. In order to use a skill, you will have to perform a quick minigame to determine its effectiveness. As you level up, you will unlock more skills. Attacks and Spells are offensive. The base damage they deal is determined by how well you execute their minigame, but the final damage dealt is also affected by the enemy's defense against the chosen type of skill. Higher-tier Attacks and Spells are more powerful, but also harder to execute. Actions are defensive, and there are only two available: Flee and Recover. Flee exits a battle (if executed correctly), while Recover restores up to half of your maximum health and can cure status effects if performed well enough. Lastly, there are three status effects which enemies can give you: Poison, Dizzy, and Panic.  - - - CHANGELOG - - -

 Not quite finished entry for http://midwestgamejam.org left/right to steer, 'z' to draw in the sail, 'x' to let it out. Finish all the waypoints without running aground! General Sailing tips: Sailing with the wind is easy enough, just let the sail out all the way. You can get the most power this way, but you can't sail faster than the wind. To sail perpendicular to the wind pull the sail in to about a 45 degree angle. This will give you a lot of power for acceleration. Then you can pull the sail in even more to trade power for speed. It's sort of like gears on a car, and you can sail much faster than the speed of the wind this way. Lastly, you can't sail directly against the wind, but you can still sail well up to 45 degrees of the wind if you pull the sail in close. Then just zigzag back and forth across the wind. This is called tacking. Changes:
1.1 - Made tacking more forgiving and added red limit lines to make the sail mechanic more intuitive.",FairWinds

 TL;DR
Dungeon crawler with 28+4 different abilities (let me know which ones you like the most) Game Description
This is a light-weigh dungeon crawler in which you bring a party of 4 adventures into a maze consisting of 4 levels of 4 rooms, each level ending in a boss fight. You play as one character at a time but need to switch to the other 3 in order to finish a room. Every time you switch, more monsters spawn. In each room there also spawns an ""aspect power"" that transforms your current character to a different aspect (and spawns more monsters!). Each aspect gives that character a new ability. Music Credits
The music is composed by Robby Duguay, source: https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2619 Big thanks! Development Notes
This game took me aaaages to make. If I had known it would take this much time I wouldn't have started, heh. There were two main time sinks: trying to figure out the abilities, and banging my head against the token limit. Thanks to the Brynolf brothers for the ""unp"" method, which saved me countless of tokens and made this game possible. The game has not my personal intro or a title screen because I'm out of tokens. Which leads me to... Mini Rant
The token limit is a really annoying part of pico8 and I wish it would be removed. The compression limit is a much better limiter than both the token limit and the character limit, and that one is hidden in the ""info"" command. There should be no difference between writing ""1,1,1,1"" and {1,1,1,1}, but since strings are counted as 1 token it's the only viable way to store that kind of data.
End of rant... Hope you enjoy the game and please let me know if you manage to beat it. UPDATE 1.2(b) UPDATE 1.3",ItTakesFourtoParty

 Picotris Attack is an implementation of the SNES classic competitive puzzle game. How to play:
Clear blocks to prevent the stack from rising to the top. Use button 2 to swap the tiles covered by the cursor. Tiles may be swapped with empty space for vertical movement. Use button 1 to manually raise the stack. Matching at least 3 tiles of the same color (either horizontally or vertically) will clear the tiles. Matching more than 3 tiles at once -- or via chain reactions caused by falling tiles -- will send ""garbage"" blocks to your opponent's stack. (In 1-player, the blocks are instead sent to your garbage block score in the top-right corner of the screen.) Garbage blocks can only be broken by matching adjacent regular tiles. Special ""attack"" tiles (gray with a !) are added to the rising stack at random. Matching 3 or more of these will send special garbage blocks which do not break along with adjacent standard garbage blocks. They may be cleared in the same way, though. The 1-player game is fun and addictive but the 2-player game is where it really shines. This was developed along with  @stephan_gfx.",PicotrisAttack

 Clean the skies of sector Q97-C with your trusty mining laser.
Keep an eye out for debris, not to mention Turrets and Tormentors. Controls:
Arrow keys control roll and yaw.
X-key accelerates.
Z-key fires laser. Tips:
Full 3D navigation can be tricky, so keep an eye on your radar at the bottom.
It can be easier to sweep the laser up over targets than to try to hit them dead on.
Watch out because the laser uses your ship's power, which only refills slowly over time. Version Notes:

EDIT 2018-04-10: Added support for some things that did not exist in PICO-8 when I first made this: saving to cartdata (and ""cash out"" menu option to reset), button glyph on title screen",VideoPoker

This is a port of a Flash game from Kian Bashiri called ""You Have To Burn The Rope"". It's a really hard game. You have to burn the rope there. Here's a pretty apt description of the game, according to its original programmer: You Have To Burn The Rope is, by formal definitions, a game since it has all the things that make up a game - besides losing condition which I regret not adding - but I wouldn't call it a game since it is hardly interactive in any meaningful way. The point was to make fun of other games that limit the player's interaction by being easy, linear, or heavily controlled and jokingly ask at which point these games also cease to be games. If at any point you are stuck, I suggest that you check out the enclosed instruction book.",YouHaveToBurnTheRope

57,Oli414,https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=20042,Micro-8 (Fantasy Console-ception),https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=30368,No License,"Intro What if there was a fantasy console in a fantasy console? That's a question that I never got. Instead, I was curious to see if I could come up with a way to get some form of programming on Pico-8. Well, here you go. The language resembles CPU instructions. The fantasy console allows up to 256 instructions in ROM and has 256 byte RAM which can be viewed at runtime. The console itself comes with a 16x16 1-bit display and 6 buttons. All IO can be directly accessed and manipulated through RAM. For convenience, it's marked with green (display) and yellow (input) in the editor. Also, I came up with this idea due to the Ludum Dare theme ""The more you have, the worse it is"". I actually did it during Ludum Dare and finished it in time. I guess it's an unofficial Ludum Dare entry :-) Usage Navigating the editor can be done using the D-pad (arrow keys). Most interactions are done using X.
The available interactions can be seen at the bottom of the editor. For the sake of space I decided to use binary to display numbers. This might require a bit of getting used to but most values can be found in decimal at the bottom of the screen when interacting with a number. Writing Code Pressing X on an empty line will display all the available instructions.
After choosing one the editor might prompt for additional parameters.
Parameters always come with a value represented as an 8-bit number.
A prompt will appear to set the value of the parameter. To remove a line of code hold the O button and press X. To move a line of code hold the O button and move it up or down using the D-pad. Once you're ready to try out your program navigate to the console in the bottom right using the D-pad.
The play button will start to blink. Pressing X will now start the program.
The play button will start blinking again once the program reaches the end.
To terminate the program (for example to get out of an infinite loop) press X and O at the same time. Saving the program can be done by pressing left twice when in the rom section.
Please note that there's a limit to the size of the program which is smaller then 256 instructions. each instructions takes between 3 and 5 byte to save and a maximum of 256 bytes are saved. Instructions Set (address value)
Sets value at address to value. Add (address, value)
Adds value to the value at address. Subtract
Subtracts value to the value at address. Jump (rom address)
Jumps the program count to rom address. Jump if zero (rom address, value)
Jumps the program count to rom address if value equals zero. Jump if not zero (rom address, value)
Jumps the program count to rom address if value equals zero (higher than zero). Or (ram address, value)
Bitwise or value to the value at address. And (ram address, value)
Bitwise and value to the value at address. Not (ram address, value)
Bitwise not for value and stores value at address. Bit shift left (ram address, value)
Shift bits to left at address value times. Bit shift right (ram address, value)
Shift bits to right at address value times. Call (rom address)
Jumps the program count to rom address and adds the current rom address to the program stack. Return
Jumps the program count the the last rom address that was added to the program stack. End Well, I hope that you folks can have a bit of fun with it. Let me know if you were patient enough to make anything!
Also, feel free to make suggestions. There's plenty of space left for more instructions if needed.

No gameplay changes this time, but I added a faux-3D stick figure dude to push the mower around.  I like him.  He's got little nubs for feet, and he sways around with the movement controls a bit.

I saw ""Advanced Mower Simul8or"" by deKay and remembered that I've been vaguely interested in making a little lawn-mowing game for a while now.

-Full mouse support (finicky on mobile)
-100 unfunny jokes
-250+ punch-lines
-The ""Joke-iary"" (Can you collect all the jokes?)
-A full in-game tutorial
-A soundtrack where every song is a remix of the Seinfeld theme
-Memes Commentary: Thanks for trying out my first game ever!  The game kind of went from a joke-telling simulator to a ""recognize the most obscure stupid reference"" simulator. It makes the game less funny to those who don't understand the references, but I think the game is better this way, lol. A big fear of mine was accidentally offending people while they're playing. Although some offensive jokes can be funny, I don't want anyone to feel personally hurt by the game. I have no intention of ostracizing anyone from playing this game. Guide: -Press ""Z"" or left click to perform actions
-Press ""X"" to access the help menu

Released at DiHalt 2021 demoparty (https://events.retroscene.org/dh2021) Creating ST NICCC clones on all possible platforms is a demoscene challenge. The original demo uses a 640KB data file. A single PICO-8 cartridge can fit only about 12KB of arbitrary data. To fit the whole 3D scene in a single cartridge, we re-created it with 3D models. In my opinion, finding clever solutions to overcome platform limitations and do what seemed to be impossible to do is the essence of the old-school demoscene. Credits: Code: Megus

• Now supports 60fps (thanks to  @zep for adding it to PICO-8 v0.1.9)
• Also made it a tad easier (was too difficult before - not sure it was really 'beatable'!)

The Land of Miskatonia needs a hero to save it from the evil Faxon and its minions. Can you be that hero? Explore Miskatonia and its settlements, talk to its residents, build up your skills, and finally challenge Faxon in its secret lair.  This is my little homage to the old-school 8-bit Ultima games as they were found on the C128. I hope you enjoy it. It exhausts almost every resource available to a PICO-8 app, and required minimization before it could be converted into a cartridge. The full source of Minima is available on GitHub for anyone interested in how it works. I have also provided a manual for it in a couple of formats, so you may want to grab and peruse the Minima manual as a PDF or the Minima manual as an ePub as well as the cartridge itself. Downloadable binaries are also available on the Itch.io Minima page. If you have any comments, questions, or even just random thoughts related to it, I'll be happy to listen. I have played all the way through and do not know of any bugs in this version (1.1.1) but I could have easily missed some. I believe this to be the best version of Minima yet. (Several months after writing that previous line, I've stumbled onto two minor glitches. They have now both been fixed in 1.1.2, so again we're back to zero known bugs.) If you enjoy Minima, you may also like the game Anteform (play online or download) that was built using the same engine. Both have similar interfaces but entirely different stories, settings, and characters. New in version 1.1.2 New in version 1.1.1 New in version 1.1 Please note that loading / saving is incompatible between 1.0 and 1.1. That is, saves made with version 1.0.X cannot be loaded into version 1.1.X. This version makes use of Tyler Neylon's JSON parser as suggested by  @freds72. Minima is still hitting the wall, but now it's the compression size wall more than the token count wall.",Minima

 Feedback is welcome.
Thank you. I know the controls are a little bit slippery, that's because of the snow. (What? TOO slippery? Maybe I have to fix it.) The base is from 'Surnned' by  @Atjowt, the animation also refers to this.
The title screen refers to 'To a Starling' by  @Peteksi.
The physics of dash, sprites and the map styling refer to 'Celeste' by  @noel.
The particle effect refers to 'Slimey, Jump!' by  @CarlosPedroso. Special thanks to  @phil and  @dw817 for giving tips and finding bugs.

These are 45 experimental Pico-8 tiny programs, exploring a variety of effects and simple ideas. I've been making these for a bit over two months now. The idea is to try out an idea, a visual effect, a generation algorithm, a quick mini-game... whatever it is that's tickling my mind at the time and do it in one sitting of 30 minutes to 4-5 hours. After I'm done I upload a gif of the result to my Twitter,  @TRASEVOL_DOG. (you should follow me, I have more doodles coming and also I make video games) That's how every single one of these 45 doodles have been made. Feel free to use any effect in your own creations, and if you do, let me know about it here on the BBS or through Twitter! You can download all the doodles from the Itch.io page!
I you like this, you can also donate a few dollars on the Itch.io page, it would help a lot and I promise I'll use them well! Enjoy the doodles!!
And happy holidays everyone!!! ps: I am sincerely very sorry about flooding the splore, I only realized it would have that consequence halfway through uploading these (it was already way too late).  Please note that the doodles are in the alphabetical order after the first one. Also, some of these are interactive! When one is, the controls will be indicated in the first few lines of the code!

Read what customers are saying about KITTENM4STERSOFT DEFRAG: > ""It really looks like it's working!"" > ""The rectangles were over there and there...but now they are all over there! Amazing!"" > ""I can't stop watching. Please send help."" Let's see how the features in KITTENM4STERSOFT DEFRAG stack up when compared with Other Leading Defragmenters: Other leading defragmenters are designed with function first, giving only a passing thought to USER EXPERIENCE. KITTENM4STERSOFT DEFRAG is revolutionizing the industry by putting user experience first! KITTENM4STERSOFT DEFRAG is the only PICO-8 defragmenter designed for one sole purpose: to give you the luxuriously satisfying experience of watching a disk be defragmented. Other leading defragmenters can also defragment, but once they finish running, your files are stuck there at the beginning of the drive, forcing you to wait hours, days, or even weeks until your disk is fragmented enough to defragment again to satisfying results. Unlike other leading defragmenters which cease to provide the user with an entertaining display of ambulating rectangles once they have finished, KITTENM4STERSOFT DEFRAG creates a new FANTASY DISK each time it is run! Open the PICO-8 menu (on keyboard, press RETURN or P) to access the following two optional modes: Enjoy the latest in popular music, perfectly paired with the enticing visuals to enhance your meditative experience. DEFRAGMENT YOUR MIND, BODY, AND SOUL! Activate SCREENSAVER MODE to disable pesky dialog boxes, enabling you to sit back and enjoy an endless supply of fresh fantasy disks get defragmented with no user interaction required!",KITTENMSTERSOFTDEFRAG

left arrow - previous song This cart emulates the Amstrad CPC/ZX Spectrum AY-3-8910 audio chip to output chiptunes to PICO-8's 5512Hz 8-bit mono PCM serial buffer. To feed the emulation it contains a sound driver capable of generating AY register inputs across three channels of tone/volume/noise-enable as well as a single shared noise tone. The sound driver was derived from 13 different CPC games and one ZX game. All these games had their music composed or converted/arranged by (the legendary, in my opinion) J Dave Rogers, who also wrote the sound driver code for the games as was customary for chiptune musicians in the 80's. This common lineage made it reasonable to reverse engineer the Z80 code and generalize the driver to handle all the games' music. I think it sounds a little better in native PICO-8 rather than on the web player. Understand however that in the CPC the AY chip was clocked at 1,000,000Hz (and 1,773,447Hz on the ZX), and emulators typically default to sample at 44,100Hz. Whereas PICO-8 ticks at 60Hz and the serial buffer samples at 5512Hz. Only so much can be done - the percussion/noise is especially vulnerable to low sampling rates. The AY emulation code is augmented to support the waveform visualization by tracking zero-crossings - this extra work can be removed if the goal is pure audio. Without the graphics, the sound driver + AY emulator runs at a consistent 24-25% of frametime on a 60hz cart. This demonstrates that, for the appropriate PICO-8 game, it's reasonable to completely emulate the music and sfx via the serial buffer. Alternatively the sound driver portion could be used to drive PICO-8's sfx/music buffers in real time which would allow a lot more music in the cart with full audio sample rate quality. Or do both and synchronize native sfx/music with generated serial buffer output. The game logos were compressed with PX9 Fixed credits for Herobotix and Battle Valley, and fixed percussion on initial part of Zynaps - thanks to feedback from Dave Rogers!

Take control of your favorite Ghostbuster and try to stop the onslaught of Slimers through 5 frantic levels of arcade action. Choose from Peter, Ray, Egon, or Winston and try to stop Gozer and her minions from taking over the world. Good luck!   Keyboard controls: Stop the Slimers from reaching the city. Use your proton beam to bust ghosts and destroy the portals. Your slime meter will fill as ghosts get by you. If your slime meter gets full, it's game over. And watch out...you don't want your proton pack to overheat! You have ghost traps but they're limited and you can only throw one at a time. And keep an eye out for the Stay Puft marshmallow man...he means the city is almost filled with slime. ===== Updated 10/2021:
To celebrate the new upcoming Ghostbusters movie, the game has been tweaked a bit to add Gozer to the script as well as setting default play to the original Ghostbusters characters. You can still switch to the girl Ghostbusters by hitting Up/Down on the title screen.  Ghost traps are no longer unlimited! You start with 3 traps and can earn more as you bust more ghosts. Keep an eye out for the orange Slimers...bust him and you'll get an extra trap. About this game:
My 5-year-old daughter loves Ghostbusters and while she's not really into video games just yet, I decided to make her a Ghostbusters game to maybe nudge her along a little bit. She's seen all the movies but likes the new Ghostbusters the most, so this game features the lady Ghostbusters...but don't worry, you can unlock Peter and the gang...just keep bustin'! All in all, it's a simple game...basically Tapper with Ghostbusters. It's not that difficult but I pretty much made with my kid in mind. It'll be a tough challenge for her but for us ""experienced"" gamers it'll be a fun but brief playthrough. Feedback and bug reports are welcome and encouraged. Thanks to everyone that helped in development. Brian Follick for turning the Ghostbusters theme into a Pico-8 track. @BeetleInTheBox for the extra graphics in short notice. And the great Pico-8 community for the support, snippets and encouragement to actually finish a game...thanks!",Bustin

Whelp. Arrows, X to serve. Bounce bricks for bonuses, multiple times for more. There's only a few levels there at the moment, so I may add more. It might be a bit hard though. Obviously I apologise for the 'music'. But nothing else. UPDATE 1  This game is too hard! I've reduced the number of bricks, made the bat a bit bigger and added some multi-ball power bricks. It's STILL too hard! Oh well.

For that reason, I've made the un-garbled code available in a Google doc at this link.  But that is exactly at the token limit!  No room for edits... so I've also provided this version, which gives you a bit of breathing room if you want to experiment, it's missing some tweaks that the final game has, which are bug fixes and extra minor features like the level intro.  What made it in: What's cut to fit into Pico-8: One of the things I had to do was crunch down the music into fewer channels, to make room for all the music in the game, making use of the arpeggio feature to simulate multiple note harmonies.  Here is a version of the game before I did this - Alternate version of main theme and water theme - the main theme and water music have 4 channels of music (no arpeggio effect).  Just play through till you fall into the water, you'll get to hear both songs.  Also this version features moving water surface and a smooth transition into the water, which was removed to save tokens (amongst other things!). If you're a developer and you want to know more about how this was put together and the hurdles I overcame, I'm currently blogging about this on my site.  I've only made one post so far, but please use the ""subscribe"" feature and I'll do an email to let you know when I make a blog update - I'm looking forward to writing about how I crammed the levels into more than the map area can actually fit!

Use Z to toggle right hand, X to toggle higher chords/notes, arrow keys to play a chord or note. Question: the thing I'd like to do with this is check to see if a sound is already playing on a given channel before I play another, so that e.g. btnp() doesn't keep retriggering a given note or chord every 4 frames if the player holds the button down instead of tapping.  I'm guessing I'd have to peek() at a specific bit of memory, but I have no idea where!",PianoSimulator

One day, you find yourself lost within a mysterious temple, when you come across a goddess incarnated as a jewel. Your job is to restore the goddess's power by breaking the seals found throughout the temple. To break a seal, you must match together all of the idols within it. This is done by moving your jewel onto arrow tiles, which shift your row or column in the given direction (and the idols along with it). Once you match up all the idols in a level, the game is over.",Egypt

34,joshmillard,https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=10166,Thopter Escape,https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2196,No License,"A game about flying a damaged ornithopter through a sand storm on Arrakis.  3 levels of windy action!  Fake speech synthesis! Instructions: Reach the end of each map without crashing into the dunes below or being overtaken by the following sandstorm.  Controls: left: tilt thopter upward (less speed, more lift)
right: tilt thopter downward (more speed, less lift)
x: fire jet (more speed, fuel recovers over time)
z: air brake (cuts speed, gain a little altitude) About the game This is my second PICO-8 game, following on the Dune theme of Shai Hulud; I wanted to make a little flying game about surviving the sand storms of Arrakis as an excuse to experiment with flight model stuff, screen scrolling, and collision detection.  I did that stuff and also played with a few other goofy ""what if"" ideas, and so the code is in places a mess of hacks, which I'm trying to embrace as an okay way to go with experimental P8 games. The map was an interesting thing to work out; I had a few ideas for how to do sand storm stuff and how to create maps dynamically to get past the limited map sheet area, but ultimately decided to make do with a pretty conservative approach of just static directional-wind tiles on a pre-rendered 1*8 string of map screens.  The method for reusing the same map for three increasingly windy levels was fun, though; if you look in the map memory on the cart, you'll see green, blue, and red arrows filling it up, and on each level I successively convert another one of those to actaul sand storm sprites as the level loads up. Music is a straight-time rendition of a bit of the extremely Toto-y soundtrack of the Lynch film. The ""speech synthesis"" is just a trio of sound effects played back together chunk by chunk in time with the words, using melodic rises and falls and rests to suggest speech.  The way this is implemented is super duper hacky, and could be formalized a little into a function and a decent data structure if I wanted to use it as more than a one-off, but I'm not convinced it's worth the effort for such a silly effect. Version history:
1.01 - Tweaked starting configuration to be less brutal to someone who hasn't been playing this for several days while developing it.
1.0 - Release",ThopterEscape

Fly around space collecting crystals to open “anomalies”. Each one will send you to another dimension where a weird challenge will present itself. Do well and your ship will be refuelled accordingly! Try to get through all 16 anomalies before you run out of fuel. All mini-games run using the arrow keys, plus Z and X on the keyboard (which correspond to the Pico-8’s O and X button prompts by default). Hope you enjoy it! Neil

But, his parts still work, and he wants to be whole again! Control each of Hobobot's two legs and two hands, and kick his head and get them all back to the torso! Controls:
z - Switch hobobot piece under control.
x - Perform action related to the current piece. Legs can kick, hands can grab.
arrow keys/dpad - Move current hobobot piece left or right. Or, perform left/right action.
enter - Bring up in-game menu. You must use this to restart the current level if you get stuck. The head cannot be controlled, you must kick it with one of the legs. There are 16 levels in total, which progress from fairly obvious mechanic-practice levels to mind-bending puzzles. Enjoy! Originally released February 28th of 2019, I decided to make a few nice updates: -Autosave so you can come back later. The puzzles are pretty tricky!
-New menu option for resetting the autosave progress.
-The first level hopefully will do a better job of teaching new players how the mechanics work.
-Kicking the head is now indicated by a small flashing kicking leg icon.
-Kicking has an extra animation frame to distinguish from the hopping animation. (Thanks discord peeps!)
-Grabbing a switch with the hand now is a toggle. Previously you had to hold down X while using arrow keys---this felt awkward---takes some mental load off of how to execute this mechanic.
-If a piece falls below the screen, an error sound is played and the level is restarted.",Hobobot

His original piece draws an animated scene which is modeled and rendered entirely by code which runs on the GPU (note: this link takes you to a webpage which runs heavy GPU code, and it will likely slow down your browser while it's running):  https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4tByz3 My version is a lot simpler.  It draws a single still image in two passes (first a depth/material-ID pass, then a lighting pass to get the final result), so be patient!  Nothing else happens after it finishes drawing the image. Unlike the original version, which uses Signed Distance Field modeling to describe its shapes, I used a point-cloud generator/rasterizer which uses a z-buffer for sorting (very similar to the triangle-renderers used in almost all current 3D game engines, but it only draws points instead of triangles).  Each object on the screen is created by some function which submits a sequence of 3D positions with material values to to the rasterizer. All lighting operations (diffuse + specular + approximated directional shadows + SSAO) are performed as a post-process, like deferred rendering in modern environments.  Since the shapes in the scene are just arbitrary collections of points, they don't have ""real"" normals - instead, all normals are approximated based on the depth buffer, after all the points have been rasterized.",LadybugSceneRenderer
